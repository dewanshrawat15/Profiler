# Profiler

The aim of this project was to automate daily boring study stuff. As a case study, quite often we are asked to search for information on stuff and present it in short. ```Profiler``` does the very same. It accepts the search query and the language code (according to ISO639-1 conventions) in which the result is to be displayed. Then, it summarises the page content and presents it in a responsive html document.

## Usage

- Download ```chromedriver``` externally, or use the one provided with the repository.
- Run ```pip install selenium``` 
- Run ```python script.py```
- Enter Search Query and Language Code (ISO639-1 convention)
- Sit back and relax
